# NVIDIA Integration for Soulvan CLI

This directory contains the integration components for NVIDIA rendering technologies within the Soulvan CLI project. 

## Overview

The NVIDIA integration allows for enhanced rendering capabilities, leveraging NVIDIA's advanced rendering technologies to achieve high-quality outputs, including support for 8K rendering and real-time ray tracing.

## Components

- **adapter.sh**: A shell script that configures NVIDIA rendering settings.
- **renderer-configs/nvidia-rtx-profile.json**: JSON configuration file for NVIDIA RTX rendering profiles, which defines settings for optimal performance and quality.
- **README.md**: This documentation file, providing an overview and usage instructions for the NVIDIA integration.

## Usage

To utilize the NVIDIA integration, ensure that your system has the necessary NVIDIA drivers and software installed. You can run the `adapter.sh` script to set up the environment for rendering.
